# 🔗 Advanced Link Block for WordPress

A powerful custom Gutenberg block that turns **any block** into a clickable link — with advanced link options, styling controls, and full flexibility.

Built to solve the limitations of WordPress’s default linking options, this block lets you **wrap blocks like buttons, groups, text, and even complex layouts** inside a single `<a>` tag — without breaking HTML validation or accessibility.
